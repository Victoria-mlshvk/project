    <h2>CHAPTER 1. Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>
    <p><b>Alice</b> was beginning to <span>get very tired</span> of sitting by her sister on the bank, <mark>and of having nothing to do</mark>: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice <strong>“without pictures or conversations?”</strong></p>

    <p><u>So she was considering in her own mind</u> (as well as she could, <s>for the hot day</s> made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>

    <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually <i>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</i>, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
